### FoxedOut
FoxedOut is a Fabric 1.21.4 mod for the FoxedIn Network Minecraft to provide easy viewing of your skills. Also works on other compatible servers, probably.
Adds a display of your skills in the top-right, with chat-based commands to adjust it. Use ".help" for help.

Was made to work rather than to work well. Don't look at the programming war crimes inside, please.
